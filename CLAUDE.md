# Features Service — CLAUDE.md

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server (tsx watch)
npm run test         # Run tests (vitest)
npm run build        # TypeScript compile
npm run db:generate  # Generate Drizzle migrations from schema
npm run db:push      # Push schema to DB (dev)
npm run db:migrate:prod  # Run migrations on prod (tsx scripts/migrate-prod.ts)
npm run generate:openapi # Regenerate openapi.json from Zod schemas
```

## Stack

- TypeScript (strict), Express, Zod, Drizzle ORM, Postgres (Neon)
- Tests: Vitest + Supertest
- OpenAPI: auto-generated from Zod schemas via `@asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi`
- Deployed on Railway via Dockerfile

## CI test flake — `EnvironmentTeardownError`

CI's `pnpm test` runs every suite **twice** — once from `src/*.test.ts` and once from the
compiled `dist/*.test.js` — so console output volume is doubled. This intermittently trips a
vitest worker-teardown race: `EnvironmentTeardownError: Closing rpc while "onUserConsoleLog"
was pending` (often attributed to `src/routes/features.test.ts`). It surfaces as **1 unhandled
error with ALL tests passing** (`407 passed`, `1 error`, exit 1). It is a non-deterministic
flake, NOT a logic failure: if the summary shows all tests green + only this teardown error,
**rerun the job** (`gh run rerun <runId> --failed`) — it passes on retry. Do not chase it as a
code bug. Follow-up worth doing: make CI run src OR dist, not both (halves runtime + the flake).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/db/schema.ts` | Drizzle table definition (source of truth for DB shape) |
| `src/lib/schemas.ts` | Zod schemas for request validation |
| `src/lib/openapi.ts` | OpenAPI spec generation (response schemas + path registration) |
| `src/lib/stats-registry.ts` | Stats key registry (raw + derived keys) |
| `src/routes/features.ts` | All feature CRUD endpoints |
| `src/routes/stats.ts` | Stats computation endpoints |
| `src/seed/features.ts` | Seed feature definitions (registered at cold start) |
| `src/middleware/auth.ts` | API key + identity header auth |
| `openapi.json` | Generated — never edit manually |

## OpenAPI Rule

Every new or changed endpoint requires THREE changes in the same PR:
1. Zod schema in `src/lib/schemas.ts`
2. Path entry in `src/lib/openapi.ts`
3. Re-generated `openapi.json` (run `npm run generate:openapi`)

**Scope:** this rule covers ENDPOINT shape changes. Editing seed feature `inputs`/`outputs`
content in `src/seed/features.ts` does NOT touch OpenAPI — the schema is `inputs: z.array(z.any())`,
so seed content never appears in `openapi.json`. No regen needed for seed-data edits.

## Seed feature inputs — `description` is an extraction prompt

In `src/seed/features.ts`, each input's `extractKey` + `description` are double-duty. The
`POST /features/:slug/prefill` route maps every input to `{ key: extractKey, description }` and
sends it to brand-service `extract-fields`, which AI-extracts the value from the brand site
(cached 30d per brandId+fieldKey+campaignId). So **`description` must be written as an
extraction-quality prompt**, not just UI help text — it's what brand-service's LLM reads to find
the value. Pick a clear `extractKey`; org name/url/logo are already known by construction (don't
ask), prefer extraction over user-entry for anything scrapeable.

## Two expert-quote features — don't conflate

- `pr-expert-quote-outreach` — autonomous PR quote outreach.
- `pr-expert-quote-opportunities` — HITL ranked queue (review → generate → send manually). `inbox` icon, displayOrder 10.

Near-identical inputs/outputs/charts. Confirm the exact slug before editing — they diverge by intent.
